                    Hey. I'm Kyle. That(â†‘) is a picture of me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a husband, dad, geek, gamer, and developer.

                    You can find me whatever gaming platform, usually as "kyleMcGriffin". Sometimes just
                    "mcGGriffin", or possibly, "kgfromthemv"

                    At the link above, you can find my github, where the repo for this site is hosted. It's called
                    "portfolio", and it is built on Laravel and Vue. I currently work at Clearlink as a Software
                    Engineer, and also do freelance work from time to time.

                    You can check out my blog, where I share my thoughts, my opinions and (sometimes) my feelings.
                    Also Twitter is a good place for that.
