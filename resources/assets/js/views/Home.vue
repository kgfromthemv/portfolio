	            <p>
	                I'm a husband, dad, geek, gamer, developer and sometimes I workout. I've been bad about that lately.

	                You can check out my blog, where I share my thoughts, my opinions and (sometimes) my feelings. One of those links will also point you to some photos of me and my family, or anything else I choose to put there.
