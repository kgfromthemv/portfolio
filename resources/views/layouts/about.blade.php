                Hey. I'm Kyle. I'm sure you gathered that based on the large title at the top of this page. That up there (â†‘) is a picture of me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a husband, dad, geek, gamer, developer and sometimes I workout. I've been trying to be better about that so I can stick around for a while. Using the links above you can find my blog posts, where I share my thoughts, my opinions and (sometimes) my feelings. One of those links will also point you to some photos of me and my family, or anything else I choose to put there. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, you can find links to my Twitter profile incase you want more thoughts/opinions/feelings, my Instagram profile incase you want more photos, and my github, incase you want to see what I'm working on.
